CALIFORNIA HOUSING PRICES PREDICTION USING TENSORFLOW

Main Aim of the project is to use the LinearRegressor class in TensorFlow to predict median housing price, at the granularity of city blocks, based on one or more input features.

Also to Evaluate the accuracy of a model's predictions using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Improve the accuracy of a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
