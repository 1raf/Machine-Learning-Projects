This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.

Two tables from database are used in this project:
Teams.csv
TeamsFranchises.csv

These tables are read into Jupyter from the sqlite3 database file which can be found here:
